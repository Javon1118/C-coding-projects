An aspiring Software Engineer
I started these coding projects based on my existing knowledge. 
However, I ultimately failed to make the code 100% original.
I scoured old Reddit forums, Discord servers, YouTube tutorials, conducted basic Google searches and even used ChatGPT in my codes to assist with creation.

I understand that not all software developers create code solely from their own minds but rather utilize code found online and optimize it (after all, we all are probelem solvers).
However, I am somewhat uncertain because these projects may not be enough to land me an internship.

Are there any particular projects, preferably in C++, that could assist me in this regard?
